	<p>This is about how to catch common fish on Long Island, NY. It will include tips on what bait, hooks, rigs, rods, reels, and line to use for fish that are caught in water around the island. If you 	have any tips or changes for me, email me. My email is at the bottom of the page. To find out when a season is open and the requirements for a keeper, can be found at <a 		href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/7894.html" > Regulations</a>.

	<h2> Scup (Porgy)</h2>
	<img src="porgy 1.jpg" alt="porgy"/>
	<p> The porgy is a small yet fiesty fish. An average porgy will weigh about 1-3.5 pounds. A monster porgy will be 5 pounds, which is getting close to the state record of 6lbs. 	4ozs. With almost nonstop action everyone will love going fishing for porgy. It's so common to see people coming off the charters with 30 gallon coolers full of porgy.</p>
	<hr>
	<p> The best way to catch a porgy is to use a hi/lo rig and clam strips as bait. Take a clam strip, and hook it about center-mass. Then you just have to wait and if you think 	you have a bite you have to set the hook right away. They do put up a fight and are really fun to catch on light tackle, 15lb test braid light action spinning rod or stuff like 	that.</p>

	<h2>Striped Bass</h2>
	<img src="striped bass 1.jpg" alt="striped bass"/>
	<p> The Striped Bass is one of the most sought after fish along the Atlantic Coast. A small striper will be anywhere from 5-10 pounds. A normal size will be about 20-30 		pounds. A monster striper will be from 40-60 pounds. The record Striped Bass on Long Island is 76 pounds.</p>
	<hr>
	<p> To catch stripers, the best bait/lures to use I think are clam strips, buck-tails, which are lead headed lures with deer hair on the back, or bunker/menhaden (both chunked and live), also just head to a local bait & tackle shop and ask for whats good. The best setup for bait is a hi/lo rig,which is two (2) hooks positioned 		about six inches apart with a weight below the hooks. The hi/lo rig is a great setup because you have 2 chances to catch a fish. If you are going to use live bunker, it would 		be best to	use a 7/0 or 8/0 Mustad Bait Saver, but no sinker. The best hook for striped bass would be a 7/0 Bait Saver Series from Mustad. The Bait Saver will help to do the 	obvious, save your bait.</p>

	<a name="Bluefish"></a>
	<h2> Bluefish</h2>
	<img src="Bluefish1.jpg" alt="Bluefish" width="300"/>
	<p>The Bluefish is a fiesty fish that will fight for a long time. The normal range of them is about 2-6 pounds and the big ones will be anywhere from 7-20 pounds. With the record at 25 pounds.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>The best way to catch a bluefish is like catching a striper. Clam-strips, buck-tails, bunker all work very well for blues and stripers.The best setup for bait is a hi/lo rig,which is two (2) hooks positioned 		about six inches apart with a weight below the hooks. The hi/lo rig is a great setup because you have 2 chances to catch a fish. If you are going to use live bunker, it would 		be best to	use a 7/0 or 8/0 Mustad Bait Saver, but no sinker. The best hook for bluefish would be a 7/0 Bait Saver Series from Mustad. The Bait Saver will help to do the 	obvious, save your bait.</p>

	<h2> Blackfish (Tautog)</h2>
	<img src="blackfish 1.jpg" alt="blackfish"/>
	<p> The Blackfish is a tough fish to catch. Most of the time it will dive down in-between rocks and wrecks making it very hard for the bait to get to them. The best place to find 	them is on or near any structure wether it be rocks or a wreck it is certain that there are fish there.</p>
	<hr>
	<p> The best bait for blackfish is probably crabs. You can go to your neighborhood Bait &amp; Tackle shop to get a blackfish jig.
	<img src="blackfish jig.jpg" alt="blackfish jig" height="75"/> Take the crab and cut it in half, now hook 		the crab through the center and out the other side. Drop down the jig and let it sit.</p>

	<h2> Flounder </h2>
	<img src="flounder 1.jpg" alt="flounder"/>
	<p> The flounder is a decent size fish. It is not the largest fish ever caught nor the smallest. Now the requirements have changed from 20.5 inches down to 19.5 inches.</p>
	<hr>
	<p> The best way to catch a flounder is a hi/lo rig. Depending on the depth and the current, you will have good luck using a 5-ounce sinker below the hooks. The best bait in 		my opinion is sandworms. Be careful because they do bite. Take a worm and put it in the hook once through the head. Then just drop it down and wait for a bite. When you 		do get a bite don't set the hook so hard or else you will wind up ripping the fishes mouth apart.</p>

	<a name="Black Sea Bass"></a>
	<h2>Black Sea Bass</h2>
	<img src="sea bass 1.jpg" alt="sea bass" width="300"/>
	<p> The Black Sea Bass is a bottom feeder, meaning it feeds on the sea floor. Most of the time they will be in about the 		2-6lb range, with a monster being 8lbs. It's fished like the porgy; same rigging, bait, and bottom conture.</p>
	<hr>
	<p> To catch the sea bass, I like to use clam and a hi/lo rig, depending on the current, with a 4-ounce weight. Hook the clam like you would any other time. When you let the weight down, it's not like a porgy when it hits, its very subtle and hard to feel.</p>
